## FEATURES OF MEMBERSHIP FOR WOOCOMMERCE PLUGIN

WooCommerce store owners already have so much to handle. And we want to simplify things for you to the bare minimum. So, we exhibit you the most appropriate and must-have features for your membership website. This free Membership plugin brings you:

* Complete User Membership History and WooCommerce Membership Details of Customers

Admin gets a quick preview section for WooCommerce Membership plans on the plans listing page. The Woo membership users too can see their history in the ‘My Account’ section with entire details of their membership plans. This will also show their WooCommerce membership details like the due date of their membership plan, their payment status, etc.


* Membership User Data Export and Import

Store owners can effortlessly export the WooCommerce membership plans along with the user data and its related settings. Similarly, the admin can also import the details of all WooCommerce membership users as a CSV file. 

Admin can also import the WooCommerce membership plans and successfully apply this import if the CSV file products are available in the store. Otherwise, it will fail. Admin can delete the plugin data on the plugin uninstall of the plugin from the database. 

* Perfectly Neat Shortcodes For Your WooCommerce Membership Plan Page Customization

We provide the admin with a remarkable collection of shortcodes that work not only on purchasing the default WooCommerce membership plan but also on the WooCommerce memberships custom page. Admin can design their plan page at ease with membership action shortcodes and membership plan shortcodes. They are for the admin’s utter convenience.


* Discount On Membership User Cart Total

Admin can apply discounts based on user roles. Give discounts only to the WooCommerce membership users. Admin can grant discounts to his WooCommerce membership customers on total cart value and even offer them free shipping as per their membership plans. This discount can be fixed or percentage-based. Entirely admin’s choice. 

* User Table for Admin

Now members will not be assigned roles. Instead, metadata will be saved and displayed in the user table as member type.

* Multi-Step Configuration of Membership for WooCommerce

With a multi-step configuration on installing the plugin, the admin gets assistance in creating his first membership plan. The home tab is also included according to the plugin configuration concept.

* Display All Membership Plans Together With Option to Buy Them
The membership plans page displays all membership plans created in your eCommerce store with their respective prices. The users can directly buy membership plans from here. 


* Membership Details and Plan Creation

Admin can display offered products and product categories in a membership plan. Those products and categories can only be accessible to users if they have purchased the WooCommerce membership plan. Admin is completely entitled to the creation and detailing of WooCommerce membership plan like:

* Plan price
* Plan name
* Plan description
* Access Type (Lifetime or Limited accessibility) 

* Create User After Payment Done

Using the free Membership for WooCommerce plugin, the admin can create a user after the complete payment. No default user will be created on your WooCommerce store immediately after membership purchase. This setting can be enabled or disabled anytime from the general setting.
